# Quant Journey

## Day 1: September 16, 2025

**Today's Progress:**
- Set up professional Python development environment (VS Code, Python 3.13.7).
- Installed core libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- Completed MIT 6.0001 Lecture 1 & 2: Introduction to Computation and Python.
- Solved MIT 6.0001 Problem Set 0, demonstrating use of `input`, `print`, variables, and the NumPy library.

**Thoughts:** The initial setup was straightforward. The shift from passive learning to active implementation is challenging but exciting. Understood the importance of managing Python environments within VS Code.
