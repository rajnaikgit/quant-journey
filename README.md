# Quant Journey

## Day 1: September 16, 2025

**Today's Progress:**
- Set up professional Python development environment (VS Code, Python 3.13.7).
- Installed core libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- Completed MIT 6.0001 Lecture 1 & 2: Introduction to Computation and Python.
- Solved MIT 6.0001 Problem Set 0, demonstrating use of `input`, `print`, variables, and the NumPy library.

**Thoughts:** The initial setup was straightforward. The shift from passive learning to active implementation is challenging but exciting. Understood the importance of managing Python environments within VS Code.

## Day 2-5: September 17-20, 2025

**Focus: Intensive Problem Solving & Mastering Core Concepts**

**Progress:**
- **Mastered Concepts:** Deep dive into control flow (loops, conditionals), functions, and data structures (`tuples`, `lists`, mutability) from MIT 6.0001 **Lectures 3, 4, and 5**
- **Solved Problem Set 1:** A challenging set of three progressively complex financial simulations:
  - **Part A (`ps1a.py`):** Built a basic financial model to calculate months needed to save for a house down payment, given a fixed salary.
  - **Part B (`ps1b.py`):** Enhanced the model to incorporate semi-annual salary raises, requiring careful control of state variables within a loop.
  - **Part C (`ps1c.py`):** **The capstone.** Implemented a bisection search algorithm to efficiently determine the optimal savings rate required to reach a down payment goal within 36 months. This required integrating all previous concepts and designing a logical search algorithm.

**Thoughts:**
This was a demanding but transformative phase. Moving from understanding concepts to applying them to multi-layered problems required intense focus over several days. The introduction of data structures in Lecture 5 provides the tools to manage complex data, which is essential for advanced projects. The breakthrough on implementing the bisection search algorithm was particularly rewarding, moving from abstract understanding to a functional and efficient solution. This struggle was invaluable for developing true problem-solving skills, not just coding syntax.

- [Problem Set 1(b) Solution](./ps1b.py)
- [Problem Set 1(c) Solution](./ps1c.py)

## Day 15 [September 30, 2025]: Getting Back on Track

**Progress:** Resumed the MIT 6.0001 curriculum, completing Lectures 6 (Recursion & Dictionaries) and 7 (Debugging). Also established a daily workout routine to support long-term physical stamina and focus.

**Thoughts:** The path is non-linear. The key is consistent recommitment.
